# Core Architecture Rules

## Single Source of Truth (SSOT)

- TagManager: All hardware communication
- ConfigManager: All configuration management
- MessageBroker: All pub/sub messaging
- UIUpdateManager: All UI updates
- StateManager: All system state

## Component Requirements

1. Hardware Communication:
   - Only TagManager can use hardware clients
   - Must handle connection failures gracefully
   - Must validate all hardware operations

2. UI Components:
   - Must inherit from BaseWidget
   - Must register with UIUpdateManager
   - Must implement async cleanup
   - Must use Qt6 enum classes

3. Error Handling:
   - Must catch and log all exceptions
   - Must provide context in error messages
   - Must handle async operations properly

## Development Standards

1. Code Style:
   - Follow PEP 8
   - Use type hints
   - Document public interfaces
   - Keep methods focused and small

2. Testing:
   - Write unit tests for new features
   - Mock hardware dependencies
   - Test error conditions
   - Verify message patterns

3. Dependencies:
   - Document in requirements.txt
   - Pin major versions
   - Use virtual environment
   - Minimize external dependencies
